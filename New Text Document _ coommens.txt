“The differences between SoNo and SpiNo conditions were statistically significant except for the duration was 3 ms seconds combined with a frequency of 1000Hz.” This does not seem to agree with Fig 5
Fig 9: I think the x and y axes should be switched.
Fig 10: I think the x and y axes should be switched.
Fig 11: I think the x and y axes should be switched.
It is also not completely clear to mean what the results in these plots mean. Please explain
“By utilizing the mean rank differences, the groups can be ranked, based on their performance” What does “performance” mean in this context?
“the critical difference value (CD = 1.258 for the 18 and 48 ms data)” How is the CD value determined? What is it for 3 ms?
